# LabVIEW CLI Custom Operation Scaffold

This note defines the disposable workspace scaffold used to bootstrap
repo-owned LabVIEW CLI custom operation authoring from NI's installed
`AddTwoNumbers` example without vendoring NI example files into git.

## Purpose

Use the scaffold helper when an agent or human needs a repeatable starting point
for a future repo-owned custom operation payload such as
`PrintToSingleFileHtml`.

This helper does not promote the NI example into the repository.

- It copies from the installed example tree on the host.
- It defaults the destination into `tests/results/_agent/`.
- It emits a machine-readable receipt that records the source example path and
  LabVIEW path/version hint used for the scaffold.

## Entry points

- Helper: `tools/New-LabVIEWCLICustomOperationWorkspace.ps1`
- Receipt schema:
  `docs/schemas/labview-cli-custom-operation-scaffold-v1.schema.json`
- Focused test:
  `tests/New-LabVIEWCLICustomOperationWorkspace.Tests.ps1`

## Default source and destination

- Default source:
  `C:\Users\Public\Documents\National Instruments\LabVIEW CLI\Examples\AddTwoNumbers`
- Default destination root:
  `tests/results/_agent/custom-operation-scaffolds/`

If the destination is inside the repository, the helper only allows child paths
under `tests/results/_agent/custom-operation-scaffolds/`.

The shared scaffold root itself is not a valid destination. This keeps `-Force`
from wiping the entire disposable scaffold area in one call.

## Usage

Scaffold into the default disposable results root:

```powershell
node tools/npm/run-script.mjs history:custom-operation:scaffold
```

Scaffold into an explicit disposable path:

```powershell
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File tools/New-LabVIEWCLICustomOperationWorkspace.ps1 `
  -DestinationPath tests/results/_agent/custom-operation-scaffolds/manual-authoring `
  -Force
```

## Receipt

Successful runs emit `labview-cli-custom-operation-scaffold@v1` with:

- source example path
- destination path
- destination policy (`repo-results-root` or `outside-repo`)
- receipt path
- LabVIEW path hint
- LabVIEW version hint
- copied file inventory

## Boundary

This scaffold is bootstrap only.

- It does not prove that the custom operation executes correctly.
- It does not resolve the host hang tracked in `#1472`.
- It does not make the eventual payload promotable on its own.

It exists so the payload-authoring lane tracked by `#1469` has a deterministic,
repeatable workspace bootstrap instead of manual copying from the NI install
tree.
